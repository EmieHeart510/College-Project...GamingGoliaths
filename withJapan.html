                <h3>From a Different Pespective</h3>

                <p>
                    Japan has casted a lot of influence into American video games. Because of the friendly relations the two countries have
                    with each other, it is no doubt that they have rubbed off on each other.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The politics and the views that both of countres have with each other
                    also can have an influence on the video game industry.
                    <br><br><br>
                    The United States views Japan in a favorable light and has confidence with whatever actions that Japan takes.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Americans overwhelmingly see Japanese people as hardworking, inventive, and honest. Most Americans also see Japanese people as non-agressive
                    and selfless. They do not associate negative stereotypes with people in Japan.
                </p>

                <h3>Are the Video Games that Much Different?</h3>

                <p>
                    <b>Violence</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Are Japanese and USA video games less violent than one another? Not in the slighest.
                    Just because Japan is viewed as a non-violent country does not mean extremely gory video games
                    do not exist among their titles. However, there is a very significant difference in violent games
                    when it comes to choice of weapons. There is significantly less gun violence in Japanese games, most likely due
                    to Japan's anti-gun laws.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Content</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Role-playing Games (RPG), Fighter, and Action Adventure genres are still pretty popular in American and Japanese video games.
                    Japanese games tend to be more story heavy and character-focused compared to American video games, and also tend to have
                    female characters as a centralized main character. Japanese games appeal to a more widely and as they also try to be inclusive with
                    a female audience.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Struggles</b>
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned in
                    About one-third of the game developing industry, as a whole, lost workers whether it was termination of employment or voluntary termination.
                    Many gaming companies believe the reason for behind such drastic numbers is pandemic related - however, the industry itself is very demanding
                    on it's workers, whether it is being overworked or having tight-deadlines, many game developers find it difficult to stay in their positions for a long term.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Rating Systems</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Japanese games still rate their video games, just like the United States does. However, the Age Ratings are rated on a different system:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A: Ages 11 and under</li>
                        <li>B: Ages 12 and up</li>
                        <li>C: Ages 15 and up</li>
                        <li>D: Ages 17 and up</li>
                        <li>Z: Ages 18 and up</li>
                    </ul>
