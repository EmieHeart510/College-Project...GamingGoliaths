                <h3>From a Different Pespective</h3>

                <p>
                    It is no question that Japan trusts the United States, as the United States is their most important ally.
                    <br><br><br>
                    A lot of the video games made in Japan revolve and are catered to the United States, as the Western ideal does
                    sell more for a more broader market.
                    <br><br><br>
                    Japan, as a whole, likes the United States. Even though Japan sees Americans as an aggressive bunch, they think
                    the United States is very inventive.
                </p>

                <h3>Are the Video Games that Much Different?</h3>

                <p>
                    <b>Violence</b>
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned in the U.S.A.'s POV page, Japanese and American games are no strangers to creating gory and violent video games.
                    However, First Person Shooter (FPS) games are much more common in the United States than Japan. For example, some of the
                    most popular game titles known in the United States are Call of Duty, Tom Clancy's Randbow Six, Halo, and Overwatch.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Content</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Just because the United States has more FPS games in Japan, does not mean they do not share the love for Role-Playing Games (RPG),
                    Action Adventure, and even Otome visual novel games. Japan cares about story depth games, while you see American video games lean
                    more towards presentation. Western games tend to focus more on realism than fantasy.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Struggles</b>
                    <br><br>
                    As mentioned in USA's POV page, America's gaming industry also faces struggle with massive turnovers - whether it is massive layoffs or voluntary resignations.
                    Due to the demanding work environments, workers find it difficult to find long-term employment in the industry.

                    <br><br>

                    <b>Rating Systems</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Both Japan and the United States rate their games, depending on how mature the game is and for generalized age groups.
                    Even though both countries rate their games with letters, American games are categorized differently.
                    <ul>
                        <li>E (Everyone): Suitable for all ages</li>
                        <li>E10+ (Everyone 10+): Suitable for ages 10 and up</li>
                        <li>T (Teen): Suitable for ages 13 and up</li>
                        <li>M (Mature): Suitable for ages 17 and up</li>
                        <li>AO (Adults Only): Only suitable for ages 18 and up</li>
                        <li>RP (Rating Pending): Rating is pending</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
